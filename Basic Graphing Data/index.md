Its like a Hackerthon but for Data Nerds, like myself, who enjoying finding business intelligence from big data sources to create viable solutions to the commonwealth of Virginia.

Here is a video showing the Virginia Datathon 2020 that I did along with other members of the MSBA program at the College of William and Mary.  I was just starting the program and I was utilizing Tableau to create dashboards and stories for the theme: Communities and COVID-19:

I loved the Datathon so much from 2020, I did it again in 2021 with a completely different team and it was another amazing experience!!!  I love when Data talks to me üòÄ
