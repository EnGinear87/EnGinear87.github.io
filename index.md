Hello World!

It seems like that phrase is constantly being used to captivate people into the unknown world of data analysis but thank you for taking the time to visit my page and understand who I am as a person.  In my current job, I work as a Global Support and Test Engineer for Inspire ([LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melvinwayneabraham/)) which is a software company owned by Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence.  I create technical documentation ([Inspire Technical Documents](https://support.hexagonmi.com/s/topic/0TO3z0000002gxiGAA/inspire)) , videos ([Inspire Training Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxYO3BiCCJfpnbILJeWRAufvSUglQU_ys)) while finding bugs and providing real-time support for our customers.  As issues arise out in the field, I try my hardest to alleviate issues with the sales, engineering, operations, or product development teams so the customer is happy.  This is what drives me daily and I will continually think about the desires of my customers first before anything because they drive innovation, improve user interface workflows, and continually give feedback about our products.  So why not listen to them and see how we can make their lives easier using our products?

When I first decided to pursue a Master of Science in Business Analytics at the College of William and Mary, I didn‚Äôt understand how much data can have an impact on my life.  If you think about analytics, it‚Äôs at the base of everything we do almost like a shadow we can‚Äôt see unless we have it right in front of us.  Now we can mine data to create business intelligence visualizations so we can see trends, alleviate bottlenecks, and constantly improve common elements we‚Äôve encountered before.  We have all probably heard the expression ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always been done that way‚Äù but data analysis gives us an opportunity to change the narration through a compelling story like the one I am writing now.

GO TRIBE!!!

Okay back to the intro‚Ä¶ I want to be the person who has a positive impact on the world through statistical processing of data that transposes our inherit abilities and encapsulates our true desires and passions through business analytics.  It‚Äôs not static but rather a constant improvement that is molded from diverse experiences that explain my inner character in my personal ([The Historic First Baptist Church - Communications](https://firstbaptistchurch1776.org/ministries/opp-detail/498727/communications/))  and professional life ([Hexagon - Inspire](https://www.hexagonmi.com/en-US/products/metrology-software/inspire)).  I love helping people grow and prosper in life and finally understand that this program was designed for students to understand the importance of life and how we can analyze the past behaviors to create a better future for the generations to come.  We can model old data to predict consumer behaviors, transform raw data into actionable insights and create a relationship with people who love using our products.  My greatest fear is not reliving the past because it comes with a learning experience, but data can provide a story that transcends from generation to generation.  So, my question to you is, what is your story?
