Hello World and thank you for researching my website that I created on GitHub.  When I first decided that I wanted to pursue a Master of Science in Business Analytics at the College of William and Mary, I didn’t understand what it truly meant to love and appreciate your work and the impact it can have on your life, but now I do.  During my past time as an undergraduate student, I was always seeking something that would explain my desires of keeping things in a logical flow which lead me to Industrial Engineering. I became captivated with process flows, creating diagrams for potential bottlenecks and seeing how to measure things that can constantly improve tasks or efficiency through subtle changes.  Just think about a time when you were running late to something and how you logically organized your thoughts into one stream of consciousness to leave out of the door in exactly 15 minutes.  If you think about analytics, it’s at the base of everything we do almost like a shadow we can’t see unless we have it right in front of us and determine how to achieve the next level by recognizing common elements we’ve encountered before.  My path of light has been shown and I want to be the person who has a positive impact on the world through statistical processing of data that transposes our inherit abilities and encapsulates our true desires and passions through business analytics.
